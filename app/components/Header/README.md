# Header

## Notification dropdown

Everything regarding notifications are imported and passed from [AppRoute](https://github.com/webkom/lego-webapp/blob/master/app/routes/app/AppRoute.js) down to `Header`, and then further down to `NotificationDropdown`. This is in order for the notifications to be fetched when the webapp in itself is initialized.
