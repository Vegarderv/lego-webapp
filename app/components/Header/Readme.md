# Header

## Notification dropdown

Everything regarding notifications are imported and passed from [AppRoute](https://github.com/webkom/lego-webapp/blob/master/app/routes/app/AppRoute.js) to Header, and then to NotificationDropdown. This is in order for the notifications to be fetched when the webapp is initialized.
